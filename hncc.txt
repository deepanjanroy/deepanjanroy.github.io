Question 1
==========
You're given a 1.0 GB file full of 8 bit integers. Sort the integers.
(After you've conceptually solved this, if you want to actually implement this, you might want to figure out a way to generate a binary file with 8bit random integers, and a way to parse back these numbers and sort them.) 

Question 2
==========
Given a binary tree, check that it is a binary search tree. 
If you want to implement this, first decide on how you would represent binary trees in your favorite language, and then code your bst-checking algorithm.

Code golf
==========
1. Write a program to output 2015. You cannot use the digits 0-9 in your program, nor can you use modules like date or time or a carefully chosen random-seed. Whoever writes this using the fewest possible character wins!

2. This is a classic problem: write a quine, i.e. a non-empty program that takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. Don't google for answers! Try to come up with one in your favorite language. 
(Note: This might take you multiple days - but it's one of the most fun problems to think about in computer science)
