Question 1
==========
You're given a 1.0 GB file full of 8 bit integers. Sort the integers.
(After you've conceptually solved this, if you want to actually implement this, you might want to figure out a way to generate a binary file with 8bit random integers, and a way to parse back these numbers and sort them.) 

Question 2
==========
Given a binary tree, check that it is a binary search tree. 
If you want to implement this, first decide on how you would represent binary trees in your favorite language, and then code your bst-checking algorithm.
